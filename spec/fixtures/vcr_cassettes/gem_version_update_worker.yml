        info: ! "Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are\nspecified
          in standard Ruby syntax.\n\nRake has the following features:\n\n* Rakefiles (rake's
          version of Makefiles) are completely defined in\n  standard Ruby syntax.  No XML
          files to edit.  No quirky Makefile\n  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a
          space?)\n\n* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.\n\n* Rake supports rule
          patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.\n\n* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays
          but know about manipulating\n  file names and paths.\n\n* A library of prepackaged
          tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,\n  tasks for building tarballs
          and publishing to FTP or SSH sites.  (Formerly\n  tasks for building RDoc and Gems
          were included in rake but they're now\n  available in RDoc and RubyGems respectively.)\n\n*
          Supports parallel execution of tasks."
